# Neural-Network-Learning
 
 # Purpose
 My attempt to build a neural network framework from scratch, this mainly for my own learning and to help me improve my understanding of neural networks and meachine learning. 
 
 The neural network I built so far can handle regression problems, and uses Sochastic gradient decent as the optimization function.
